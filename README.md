# Radius2d

An experimental Physics Engine implementation.
It uses [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) for rendering purpose. It was once written in C++, but now recently have been changed into C# for having better Object-Oriented approach on this, so it currently in the early-development stage.

Currently it doesn't have that much of functionalities, It only checks collision between circles and responds on them.

## Compile

To compile this, you need the .NET Framework and simply execute ``dotnet run`` in the ``/radius2D`` directory.
