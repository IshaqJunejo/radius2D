# Radius2d

An experimental Physics Engine implementation.
It uses [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) for rendering purpose, and is currently written in C++, but hopefully will soon write it in C#, as it have some better Object-Oriented Programming way. 

Currently it doesn't have that much of functionalities, It only checks collision between circles and responds on them.
